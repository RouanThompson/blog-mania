                <div>
                    <h4 className="story"> An ex-Nursing student turned Web Developer. Coding was my original joy 10 years ago when I was younger and in college. A lot of folks told me not to get involved with it because the job outlook was awful. Young and Impressionable, I took their counsel, and I became a nursing student some years later. I was close to graduating, but then I realized I never loved being a nurse. After a lot of failures in nursing school, I realized it was time to revaluate myself and think about what I enjoyed doing. I remembered that I took a class in programming C++ and it was intense, stressful, but a lot of fun! I started googling around for schools and came across Flatiron. However, I had just missed the scholarship deadline, and I decided to do self-study at 42 School Silicone Valley in California for a year learning to programing in C. Still, something was missing. What does it mean to be a programmer? I still did not understand. I eventually moved back to Brooklyn, NYC, and I got an email saying that the Flatiron Web Fellowship Scholarship is now open! I still can't believe I got accepted. The program is tough, fast past, and there were some sleepless nights. 2020 did not make it easier for us neither. Now graduation is in a couple of hours, and I finally have a better sense of what it means to be a programmer...I finally know what it means to be a Web Developer</h4>
